# Starting a server
The latest version of feather can be found and downloaded from our [github release page](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/releases). Feather is platform dependent, therefor you must download the version corresponding to your operating system and your processors architecture.

The zip file contains a single executable that is compiled to the given target that when executed will generate a few files notable `world/` and `feather.toml`, so it is recommended to execute the server in a separate folder.

## Windows
After downloading and unzipping the executable `feather.exe` you can start it by simply double clicking it.

## Mac OS-X
After downloading and unzipping you can execute feather from the terminal
```
./feather
```

## Linux
After downloading and unzipping you can execute feather from the terminal
```
./feather
```
