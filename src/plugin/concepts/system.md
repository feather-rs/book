# System

Feather is structured with a number of systems running in series, these system may perform their calculations in parallel by utilizing [*Rayon*](https://docs.rs/rayon/1.3.0/rayon/). These systems emit events that effects their outcome, for instance the `block_place_system` system emits both `BlockChangeEvent` and `InteractItemEvent`. The listeners attached to these events may poll in arbitrary data from the world and this is the major reason Systems are run in series and not parallel.
